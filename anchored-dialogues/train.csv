3067,283,107906,15,1,"I'm sorry that you're confused, it is a tricky question.  Normally, you would have had the correct answer, back when you said y=10.  The tricky bit of this question is that there is already a 10 in the data so the range is already 7 (10-3). ","<None>"
3067,283,107906,16,1,"So, you're completely correct that y could be equal to 10 and then the range is still 7, still 10-3.","<None>"
